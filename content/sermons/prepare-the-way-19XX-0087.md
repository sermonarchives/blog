_This sermon is a combination of typing and handwriting in red and black ink. It lists a date, but not a year. Since Advent 2 is listed, we can assume that it was a Sunday, so this sermon was probably preached in 1973 or 1979, since those are two years that 12/9 was on a Sunday._

_The Gospel text is listed as [Luke 3:1-6](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=96), which corresponds to the second week of Advent in year C. There is a hymn listed to follow the sermon, [Lord, speak to me, that I may speak 538](https://hymnary.org/hymn/SBHC1958/538). I found a recording of the Hymn, and will include it below the sermon._
