_This sermon was actually untitled, so I made a title up for this archive.  It was a combination of typed and handwritten, and was preached in 1974._

_The Gospel text for this sermon is Luke 18: 9-14. He references a poem by 17th century poet [Richard Crashaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Crashaw) called [Pharisaeus et Publicanus](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38550/38550-h/38550-h.htm#Page_35), which is available via Project Gutenberg. The sermon lists "23 Pentecost" as the lectionary, but the Gospel text from Luke is now a part of the [20th Sunday after Pentecost in Year C](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=384&z=p&d=81) of the Revised Common Lectionary._
