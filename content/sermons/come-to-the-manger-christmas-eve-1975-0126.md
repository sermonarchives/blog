_This is a handwritten Christmas Eve sermon from 1975. It is handwritten in pencil, with highlights in red and blue pencil, and a few written additions in black ink, including changing the title of the sermon._

_The gospel text is from Luke 2.  Since the year of this sermon is 1975, I'm going to guess that it was [Year B](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=382&z=c&d=5) in the Revised Common Lectionary._
