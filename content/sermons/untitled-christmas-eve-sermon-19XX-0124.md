_Here is an interesting Christmas Eve sermon. It is undated, partially typed, but with notes and additions in red and green marker. It is typed on two "From the Pastor's Desk" notes taped together._

_The gospel text is from Luke 2, which means that it is part of the Christmas season, not Advent.  I'm going to guess that it was [Year B](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=52) in the Revised Common Lectionary._
