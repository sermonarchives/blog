_This is an undated Christmas sermon.  My guess is that it's from the early 1970's._

<!--more-->

_This sermon was in the pile of "Christmas C" sermons, so my assumption is that it is from then, especially since it references the birth of Jesus. It also appears to reference the classic Christmas story in the gospel text._
