_Here is a typed sermon from 1990 Christmas season, preached on December 30, 1990. The sermon is highlighted with yellow highlighter._

_The sermon makes reference to both a football coach and basketball practice, making this one of the most sports-filled sermons that I have seen so far. The gospel text of Luke 2:39-40 correlates to the [First Sunday after Christmas](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=55) in the Revised Common Lectionary._
