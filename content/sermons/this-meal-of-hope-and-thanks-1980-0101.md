_This is another example of a "same name, different sermon" sermon.  It has the same name as the previous sermon from 1975, but this one is typed and from 1980. There are also notes in light blue ink._

_There are certainly similarities between the sermon from 1975 and this sermon from 1980, but it seems like this is an expansion of the original sermon's concepts, because there are several new things that were added to this sermon.  It makes sense, since the gospel message is from Matthew 5, which corresponds to the All Saints Day text for [Year A](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=17134&z=p&d=83) in the Revised Common Lectionary. Also, the first sermon was likely preached at [Ascension in Navarino, WI](http://www.ascensionavarino.com/), but the date on this sermon likely means that the sermon was preached at [St. Stephen in Wausau, WI](https://sslcwausau.com/)._
