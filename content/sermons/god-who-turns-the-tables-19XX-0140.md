_Here is an undated handwritten lenten sermon. My guess is that it was preached in Navarino in the 1970s. It is written with blue ink, and includes edits and markups in red pen._

_The gospel text is listed as John 2:13-22, which is [The Third Sunday in Lent](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=73), but the indication of 3 Lent B was added later, probably when the Lectionary was revised. There is a reference to [JB Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bertram_Phillips) in this sermon, who was a clergyman and Bible translator._
