_This is a lenten sermon from March of 1992. It is scanned and highlighted, and the margins have references to "L" and "G", but I don't know what they mean._

_The gospel text is from Luke 4, matching the text for the [first Sunday of Lent, Year C](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=118). At the end of the sermon, there is a reference to Hymn 229, "[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God](https://hymnary.org/hymn/LBoW1978/229)"._
