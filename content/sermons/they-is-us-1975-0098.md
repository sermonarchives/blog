_Here is a handwritten Pentecost sermon from 1975, written in a combination of blue and red ink._ A portion of this sermon was crossed out, so it is unclear if that portion was preached.

_The title of this sermon is a reference to an earth day poster and comic by the satirical comic strip named [Pogo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogo_(comic_strip)), which is the source of the quote [We have met the enemy, and he is us](https://library.osu.edu/site/40stories/2020/01/05/we-have-met-the-enemy/). The Pogo comic strip ran from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. The sermon text comes from the [19th Sunday after Pentecost, Year A.](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=17134&z=p&d=78)_
