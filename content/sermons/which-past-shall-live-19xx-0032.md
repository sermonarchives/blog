_This is an undated sermon that has "Reformation" written at the top, likely making it a Reformation Sunday sermon.  The gospel text is John 8:32. The sermon references that it is a pleasure to be a guest preacher, but it does not indicate where he was a guest. The format of the sermon is an interesting mix of typing and handwriting._
