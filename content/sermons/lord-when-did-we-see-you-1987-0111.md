<!--more-->

_The [Challenger disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster) was mentioned during this sermon. It also mentions the [For Want of a Nail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Want_of_a_Nail) proverb. An incident involving an airline flying over the Bahamas was mentioned, and it is likely that he is referring to [Eastern Airlines Flight 855](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Air_Lines_Flight_855). The sermon also mentions [Vince Lombardi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Lombardi). A late addition to the sermon appears to be about [Sister Mary-Miriam Friday](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/133139335/mary_miriam-friday), who was murdered in October of 1987 in Chicago._
