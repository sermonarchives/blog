_Scanned, handwritten sermon for Easter of 1978.  My guess is that this was preached at Ascension in Navarino._

_Gospel text noted as Matthew 28: 1-10, which likely puts this sermon into [Year A for Easter in the Revised Common Lectionary](http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=38)._
