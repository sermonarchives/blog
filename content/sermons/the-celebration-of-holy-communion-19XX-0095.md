_This is an undated sermon from the season of Pentecost. It is partially typed, then marked up and finished in red pen. It is marked up with both normal pencil and blue pencil. My guess is that this sermon comes from the 1970s._

_The gospel lesson of Matthew 21:33-44 would make this sermon fit into the [19th Sunday after Pentecost of year A](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=17134&z=p&d=78)._
