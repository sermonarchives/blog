_Here is a Pentecost sermon from 1978, handwritten in blue ink with yellow highlights._

_This sermon mentions [Matthew Arnold](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/matthew-arnold) and [Oliver Wendell Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes_Jr.) by name. Although the sermon lists "26th S. Pentecost" as the lectionary, the gospel text is listed as Matthew 23: 1-12, which now correlates to the [23rd Sunday After Pentecost of Year A](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=17134&z=p&d=82) in the Revised Common Lectionary._
