_I think I found another "Intern Larson" sermon from California!_

<!--more-->

_Here are some thoughts about "Intern Larson". I'm glad he wrote the date on it, because that helps me place the sermon at [Ascension Lutheran](https://www.alcrpv.org/) in Rolling Hills, California, since he preached the 1970 Christmas sermon there. However, if most of his sermons were scribbled like this, I'm not sure if I would have made the effort to archive all of them, so I'm thankful that the presentation and organization methods improved over time._
