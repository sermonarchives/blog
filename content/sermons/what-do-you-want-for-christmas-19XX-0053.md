_This is an undated Christmas sermon, but it's probably from 1972, via an educated guess._

_This sermon was written on the back of a letter from Weston Noble on behalf of the Luther College Nordic Choir, written on 12/15/1972.  Given this fact, I'm guessing that in 1972, he took a nearby sheet of paper and wrote the sermon on that.  Some of the other sermons from this time were written on the back of bulletins and other paper that had unrelated information on the back._
