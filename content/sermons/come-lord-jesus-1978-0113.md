_Here is a handwritten sermon for the Advent season that was preached early in December of 1978._

_This sermon makes several references to the Greek words [Chronos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronos) and [Kairos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairos), so I'm leaving links to Wikipedia definitions of each word. The gospel text is Mark 13:33-37, which corresponds to the [First Sunday of Advent](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=382&z=a&d=1) in Year B of the Revised Common Lectionary._
