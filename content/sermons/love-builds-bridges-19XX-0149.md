_This is an undated, printed and highlighted sermon that does indicate a date in the church calendar, but not a date. My guess is that it's from the 1990s given it was printed from a computer._

_It lists [19 Pent C](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=384&z=p&d=80) as the church calendar date, but the stated gospel passage of Luke 16:26 now corresponds to the [Sixteenth Sunday after Pentecost](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=384&z=p&d=77). He mentions fond memories of a rusty old bridge over a river that allowed him to fish without getting his feet wet. There is also a pretty sobering story about hunger for World Hunger Sunday._
