_This is an All Saints Day sermon from 1982. There is a reference to the French meaning of RSVP, but it's apparent that he's not a French scholar._

_The gospel text is listed as Matthew 5:1-12, which matches up exactly with [All Saints Day for Year A](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=166) in the Revised Common Lectionary_
