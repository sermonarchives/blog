_The Gospel message from John 1 and the notation of "3d S. Advent" link this sermon to the [third Sunday of Advent in Year B](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=50) of the Revised Common Lectionary. This sermon uses the imagery of lights in a variety of different contexts to tell many of the stories._
