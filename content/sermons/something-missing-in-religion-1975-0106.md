_Here is a handwritten sermon from 1975, written in blue ink with highlights in red pencil. It mentions that it is also Stewardship Sunday._

<!--more-->

_The sermon specifically mentions Ascension by name, meaning that this was preached at [Ascension Lutheran in Navarino, WI](http://www.ascensionavarino.com/). Although the sermon lists "26th Pent" as the lectionary, the gospel text is listed as Matthew 23: 1-12, which now correlates to the [23rd Sunday After Pentecost of Year A](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=17134&z=p&d=82) in the Revised Common Lectionary._
