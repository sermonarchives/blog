_Here is a handwritten sermon from 1975 for All Saints Day._

<!--more-->

_The gospel message is from Matthew 5, which corresponds to the All Saints Day text for [Year A](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=166) in the Revised Common Lectionary. Also, as a personal note, this is the 100th sermon that I've archived on this site._
