_The sermon addresses the [Jonestown Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown), which occurred on November 19, 1978. The gospel text from Matthew places this sermon as the last sermon for year A, [Christ The King Sunday](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=170), which is now also known as "Reign of Christ" in the Revised Common Lectionary._
