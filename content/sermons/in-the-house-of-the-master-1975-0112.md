_Here is a handwritten Advent sermon from late November, 1975._

_There is a joke in the sermon about a teacher trying to get a promotion, and the punchline of the joke appears to be a quote that was attributed to [Stephen M R Covey](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8519324-some-people-say-they-have-20-years-experience-when-in). The Gospel text is from Mark, designating this sermon to fit into [The First Sunday of Advent, Year B](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=48). This marks the beginning of the new church year, and the start of year B in the Revised Common Lectionary._
