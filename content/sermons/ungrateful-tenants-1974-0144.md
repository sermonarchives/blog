_Here is at typed sermon from 1974 with highlights in red marker. There isn't a Gospel lesson listed, but it looks to refer to the parable of the wicked tenants, which appears in several Gospel readings._

_There is a reference to a hymn after the sermon, but the date on the sermon and the title of the hymn seem to refer to [the Service Book and Hymnal of the Lutheran Church of America](https://hymnary.org/hymnal/SBHC1958). The hymn is [When I Survey The Wondrous Cross](https://hymnary.org/hymn/SBHC1958/503a), and I am including a choral version of the hymn after the sermon._
