_This is an undated Advent sermon, likely from the early 1980's or late 1970's._

<!--more-->

_The gospel text is listed as Mark 1:1-8. Although it's listed as an Advent sermon, I don't think the text directly correlates to the current Revised Common Lectionary. The sermon mentions the 1973 film, [Godspell](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070121/)._

# **ANTICIPATION IS PREPARATION - Advent - Mk.1:1-8**

Lord, help us in these moments together to prepare your way - - into our community of faith, into our hearts. Use your word to take away the obstacles which separate us from you. Amen.
Perhaps you have seen the movie, "Godspell". It is a good introduction to John the Baptist to watch this movie begin. On the stage are many actors, all dressed in grey sweatshirts and with names across their chests like 'Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, (and even) Martin Luther". They stand up one at a time and expound their ideology-until finally all are babbling out a different story, trying to be heard above the noise of the crowd (like the tower of Babel). THEN, Suddenly there comes down the aisle an odd-looking character (a modern John the Baptist), blowing on a ram's horn. Everybody stops singing and listens to him as he sings over and over again the beautiful message "PREPARE THE WAY OF THE LORD". Soon, one by one, they join him in singing this preparation song. And what does John the Baptist carry in his hand?- a pail of water and a sponge! (to symbolize his baptism with water). He washes everyone in the crowd and they change from their grey sweatshirts to brightly colored clothes and follow John as His disciples, singing all together the preparation song: PREPARE THE WAY OF THE LORD. These are the preachers of repentance, preparation.

Not only does the movie Godspell begin with this strange man called the Baptist, but all four Gospels include him in their opening verses, proclaiming the same message- - Repent, prepare the way of the Lord. . .

I want to remind you that the "Way of the Lord" images that John uses are rich in history for the Jewish people. They are words from Isaiah and even before. In the Old Testament days the roads to a town were not the best:

* dust paths in summer
* muddy washouts in winter
* ruts and gullies in the spring

SO, if you heard that a king was coming to your town, what would you do?
GET UP A WORK CREW:

* to smooth out the sharp places where stones were sticking up
* to fill in the gullies and washouts
* to make straight the places where short detours were made around bad spots

FOR THE FIRST ISRAELITES - this road lead to their city gates

FOR ISAIAH - this road led to the royal throne in Jerusalem

FOR JOHN THE BAPTIST - the way of the Lord was something different (yet had a kingly tone to it). John's way of the Lord led to no throne, no city gates, but to the human heart. John’s call to prepare was a call to repentance, rather than roadbuilding. Preparing the way of this king is to remove the boulders which stand in the way of the Messiah as he seeks to enter our hearts and lives. Those boulders are boulders of sin, pride, stubbornness, ignorance. REPENTANCE clears them away. .

In our home, one of the meaningful things we've done in advent is to use a calendar called, "Getting Ready for a Guest". It is a house with many doors and windows which open. Behind each is a utensil for preparing the house for special company. Behind one is a broom which sweeps clean the dusty places. Behind another is a scrub brush, another hides a pail. Another shows some soap. And through each of the days of advent we read a Bible verse that calls for us to make ready for a special guest. Advent is for us a new broom that sweeps clean, a pail and scrub brush for Swabbing away the sin which encrusts us - - Advent is for anticipation and preparation.

Throughout scripture- anticipation and preparation lead to blessing. Noah not only knew that the flood was coming and waited for it - - he followed God's command to prepare. That preparation paid off.

When David faced Goliath -- he prepared himself according to God's instructions, with a slingshot, 5 small stones, and lots of practice! It paid off!

In the new Testament, Jesus speaks of being prepared for the coming of the Lord. He tells us this in the context of a wedding feast. He shows us five young girls who were foolish. They anticipated the coming of the bridegroom as much as anyone else . . . but they didn't prepare. The five wise maidens kept oil ready for his coming, so their lamps could be lit. Another Wedding feast where people were invited from the streets…. but each was to wear an appropriate garment. Anticipation also means preparation- - - then there is blessing.

The book of Revelation speaks in vivid yet strange ways about the coming of Christ - - yet the same theme is there. Look forward to the unfolding of history in God's hand. . . . Prepare--repent---put off the evil nature, that we might receive a crown of life from the Lord at His coming.

ANTICIPATE - PREPARE - RECEIVE BLESSING

How are your preparations going? Is the house ready for Christmas? Are the presents made or bought and wrapped? Is all that delicious baking ready?

Has your anticipation led to a preparation for the blessings God offers in Christ?

Have you taken some quiet time for advent devotions? Have you listened for the voice of God to tell you that this promised savior is your Savior. Have you taken time to look in the dark corners of your own life to see the dirt and the cobwebs of sin and laziness that have collected there?

Anticipate and prepare! Make the highway straight, prepare a way for Christ to enter anew. Hum an advent hymn while you are baking or shopping or cleaning. Read some of the great promise passages from scripture. Take time to pray that God would bless you with the assurance that He is IMMANUEL, GOD WITH US.

And may the peace of God which passes all understanding keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. Amen.
