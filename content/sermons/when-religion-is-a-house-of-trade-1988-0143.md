_This is a typed Lenten sermon from 1988 with highlights in either dark orange or red. It introduces the term "Soul Insurance", which I'm not sure that I was aware of._

<!--more-->

_The end of the sermon mentions that the hymn is [LBW 480 - Oh, that the Lord Would Guide My Ways](https://hymnary.org/hymn/LBoW1978/480). I will include a performance of the hymn after the sermon._
