_This typed sermon from 1983 mentions a sermon series called "Symbols That Matter", which appears to have been preached during the Lenten season of 1983 at St. Stephen Lutheran Church in Wausau._

<!--more-->

_The gospel text appears to be from Luke 20, which does not appear to be used any more in the Lectionary for the Fifth Sunday of Lent. The sermon text mentions the assassination of [Archbishop Oscar Romero](http://www.romerotrust.org.uk/who-was-romero). It also references a stained glass image of Saint Stephen that is located in the church, and I'm including an example image of Saint Stephen in stained glass below this sermon._
