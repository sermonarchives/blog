_Here is a typed sermon from April of 1982. The original church season is listed as "9th,10th Comm." which may have been first communion for 9th and 10th graders. On reading the sermon, it's more likely a reference to the 9th and 10th Commandments, though._

_The preaching text listed is from Exodus 20, which does correlate to [the Third Sunday of Lent in year B](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=382&z=l&d=27)._
