Here is a handwritten sermon from the first Sunday after Christmas in 1973. It seems rather festive, since the sermon is written in black, red, and green ink.

Apparently, it was Student Recognition Sunday! The listed gospel text is Luke 2:25-38.  This would likely put it in [1 Christmas B in the Revised Common Lectionary](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=55).
