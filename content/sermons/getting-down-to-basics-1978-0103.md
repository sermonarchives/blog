_This sermon is a homecoming of sorts. It was a handwritten sermon that was preached 1978 to the congregation where he grew up!_

<!--more-->

_The gospel lesson of this sermon is listed as Matthew 22:36, which would now fit into the [22nd Sunday After Pentecost](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=17134&z=p&d=81) in year A of the RCL. The top of the sermon mentions a welcome to Gilman in Spring Lake, WI. In addition to being Steve's home congregation, the Gilman Lutheran cemetery is also the resting place of his [father](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/153889223/maynard-larson), [mother](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/153889305/marveda-larson), and two of his siblings that died as young children, [Nancy](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/103653645/nancy-kae-larson) and [Jeffrey](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/103653522/jeffrey-lee-larson). I've included an exterior and interior picture of the church, which I obtained from Google. Gilman Lutheran Church now appears to be a part of a multi-site congregation called [Trinity Valley Lutheran Parish](https://www.tvlpsv.com/)._
