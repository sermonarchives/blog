Dear friends in Christ...grace and peace.....
Have you ever been in a situation that seems out of control? Have you ever wondered, "Who's in charge here?" That question was raised this past week as 83 spectators died at a soccer match: "Who is responsible for all this?" We would like to think that each time something goes wrong that someone will make it right....but life in this world is not that simple. In 1941, millions of Russians welcomed the Nazi troops who invaded to deliver them from Stalin's cruel regime. They received the troops with open arms, only to discover that the Nazis could be even more brutal than Stalin. We wonder: "Who's in charge? Who can deliver us?"

When Israel saw the Persian king Cyrus take up arms against Babylon, they didn't expect deliverance. But God spoke to Isaiah, and promised to anoint the strange and powerful King Cyrus to deliver God's people. Who could have expected such a miracle? But this is exactly what happened. After conquering Babylon, Cyrus decreed that all peoples should return to their homelands and pray to their own Gods for him. God's plans were being carried out through this pagan king.

How could such a strange thing happen? Because God is in charge. Even the prophet did not expect that, but it was true. God said to Cyrus, "I will go before you and level the mountains...so that you may know that it is I, the Lord, the God of Israel, who calls you by your name... even though you do not know me."

Isaiah and the Israelites in exile learned once more that God is in charge. 600 years later, Israel was dominated by a new foreign power, Rome. The presence of soldiers and tax collectors was resented. Rome milked her provinces as completely as possible. First there was the ground tax, 10% of grain, 20% of oil or wine. Then there was the 1% income tax. The most objectionable tax was the poll tax, levied annually on every adult male. It had to be paid in roman coinage...and the Jews hated the coin which they had to carry to pay the tax...because it had the graven image of Caesar upon it.
How could they in good conscience pay the tax? On the other hand, how could they refuse to pay it? Jesus' enemies come to him with this question, thinking that they can trap him in this quandary. Either he will alienate his Jewish followers or get himself into hot water with the Roman authorities.

"Show me the coin," Jesus answers. Someone fishes in his pocket and comes up with a denarius. The very fact that these Jews carry Caesar's coin is an admission that they enjoy the benefits of Roman rule: good roads, access to distant markets for their goods, peace and order. By carrying Caesar's coin, they accept what he offers. And in return they need to keep their half of the bargain and pay him his due.
And almost before the crowd can digest these startling words of Jesus, he goes on to share with even more important news: "Even as you enjoy the comforts of Rome's rule...remember to give what is due to God." Jesus asks the really important question: "WHO IS REALLY IN CHARGE HERE?" Cyrus and Caesar have come and gone from the face of earth, their kingdoms rose and fell. But God's kingdom continues to endure. We are a part of another earthly kingdom called the United States of America, and the dollars in our pockets are testimony to our participation in a social and economic system that has great benefits and also some flaws. We pay our due to Washington, (and so we should) but we must not forget to also give what is due to God.

Our coins bear images that give testimony to our government's power, faces of presidents, impressive buildings and monuments, national mascots such as the eagle and buffalo. Those are not the only images that are part of our lives. God from the beginning has reminded us that we bear his image....in creation; God has called us by name; he has redeemed us by sending his only Son. We owe God all that we are and all that we have. GOD IS IN CHARGE.

These days people question what should have their allegiance. Some people spend their whole career dedicated to their work at a company, and then find a pink slip on their desk one day. They are no longer needed. Others stay at a company in spite of frustrations, because of the promised pension....and then learn that it may not be there for them after all. Who deserves our primary allegiance: General Motors, IBM, Consolidated Widget?
Or is God in charge?

I read in a recent issue of People magazine an interview with Dr. Billy Graham as his preaching career nears its end. He gives an interesting answer to the question: "If you could do it over again, is there anything you would do differently?" His answer: "I would have spent more time at home with my wife and children." Even though Dr. Graham lived this full life of service to God, reaching millions with the Gospel, he recognizes another image that God printed upon him, the image of a faithful God upon a husband, the image of a faithful father upon an earthly father, and the image of a constant friend upon someone called to be an earthly friend.

It reminds me of a doctor who was counselling a patient whose health was being ruined by stress at work, but who refused to change his workaholic habits. The doctor said, "You know, I've been at the deathbed of many people, surrounded there by family and friends. And I've heard them say many things....but I've never yet heard a dying person say as they look back on their life: 'I wish I had spent more time at work'.

Now, I'm not encouraging any of you to be a poor employee or a poor citizen. Those dollars jingling in our pockets are testimony of what we owe our boss and our government. But I am reminding you as Jesus and Isaiah do today of who's in charge. God has placed his image upon us. We have been blessed not only with dollars in our pocket; We've been blessed with families and friends to cherish and to love. We've been given so many gifts and abilities and the call to use them to the glory of God. Our choice of being a good employee, a good citizen, a good spouse or parent, a good friend, a good steward of what God has given....this is not an either /or choice. Give to Caesar what you owe to Madison and Washington, and give to God what is God's. Give it gladly, without complaint or whimper... and you will be blessed. Invest yourself in what will not rust, or rot, or disappear. You will not be disappointed. Be a good citizen, support this community that benefits you in so many ways...and be a good citizen of God's kingdom. Remember who is in charge, and live accordingly.

+And the peace of God which passes all understanding, keep you one in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.
