_This handwritten sermon dates back to 1977, for the Fourth Sunday in Lent. He refers to a hymn that was written by Martin Luther, containing the title of the sermon in its lyrics._

<!--more-->

_The Gospel text is from Luke 15, which contains the parable of the prodigal son. As far as I can tell, the lyrics from Luther's hymn mentioned in this sermon are probably from verse four of [Dear Christians, one and all rejoice](https://books.google.com/books?id=riMkK9b5WJEC&lpg=PA75&ots=iwkRB2P93I&dq=luther%20a%20father's%20heart%20he%20turned%20to%20me&pg=PA75#v=onepage&q&f=false), if a Google Books search can be believed._

_Also, there are two notes at the bottom of the sermon which look like references to the hymns [Beneath the Cross of Jesus](https://hymnary.org/text/beneath_the_cross_of_jesus_i_fain_would) and [Come to Calvary's Holy Mountain.](https://hymnary.org/text/come_to_calvarys_holy_mountain)_
