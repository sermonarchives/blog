_Here is an Epiphany sermon from 1991. It is printed in black with yellow highlighting._

<!--more-->

_This sermon is one of the only sermons that I recall seeing so far that has a lot of references to demons, which is likely due to the gospel text from the [Fourth Sunday After the Epiphany of Year B](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=63) in the Revised Common Lectionary. In that "spirit", I've included a 14th century painting that depicts Jesus casting out the unclean spirit that was mentioned in this Gospel reading.  The painting is "Jesus casts out the unclean spirit" by [Herman de Limbourg](https://diglib.library.vanderbilt.edu/diglib-fulldisplay.pl?SID=2024020763241864&code=ACT&RC=56401&Row=12)._
