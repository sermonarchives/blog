_This sermon is a bit of an oddity. It was from December of 1979 and was performed during a midweek Advent service. Pastor Steve dressed up as John the Baptist and gave his sermon as if he had traveled through time to Wausau in 1979. The service is called "An evening with John the Baptist"._

_Here is more information about the sermon but it isn't included in the little blurb on the home screen. The gospel text of Mark 1 corresponds to the [Second Sunday of Advent, Year B](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=49) in the Revised Common Lectionary. Included is a copy of the bulletin from that day, a picture of Pastor Steve dressed as John the Baptist, as well as John the Baptist's sermon notes. It seems that John the Baptist preferred to write in pencil._
