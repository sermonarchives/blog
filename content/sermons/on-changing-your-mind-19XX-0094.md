_This is an undated sermon from the season of Pentecost. It is partially typed, then finished in pen. It is marked up with both normal pencil and blue pencil._

_The sermon lists the season as the 19th Sunday after Pentecost, but the Gospel lesson of Matthew 21 is now a part of the [18th Sunday After Pentecost](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=17134&z=p&d=77). If I were to guess a date that this was preached, I would think that it was September in the late 1980s. The handwriting near the end of the sermon is pretty small, so keep in mind that you can change the magnification of the page to make the image larger._
