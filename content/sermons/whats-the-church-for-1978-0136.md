_Here is a handwritten midweek Lenten sermon from 1978. There's even a reference to the Green Bay Packers in it! It's written in blue ink with annotations in red pen._

<!--more-->

_The gospel lesson is listed as Col. 3:16. The only place that verse seems to appear in the Revised Common Lectionary is [The First Sunday after Christmas in year C](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=384&z=c&d=8). There is also a reference to theologian [Elton Trueblood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Elton_Trueblood) in this sermon._
