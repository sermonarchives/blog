_Here is typed Christmas Eve sermon from 1981 with notes in light blue. There are several typed corrections and strikethrough that show that this was probably typed with a typewriter._

_The gospel text is from Luke 2.  Since the year of this sermon is 1981, I'm going to guess that it was [Year B](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=52) in the Revised Common Lectionary._
