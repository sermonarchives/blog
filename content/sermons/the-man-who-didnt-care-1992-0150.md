_It lists [19 Pent C](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=384&z=p&d=80) as the church calendar date, but the stated gospel passage of Luke 16:19-31 now corresponds to the [Sixteenth Sunday after Pentecost](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=384&z=p&d=77). He tells a story about the cruel family of a shut-in that he visited._
