_Here is a typed sermon from Lent of 1993 It includes a callout for confirmation students on one of the main points of the sermon. I think I may have been one of the confirmation students at the time._

_He references learning German in college, which is a fact that I did not remember.  He also mentions [Pastor Bruce Larson](https://www.seattlepi.com/seattlenews/article/bruce-larson-1925-2008-pastor-hailed-as-1295155.php), calling him "the famous Pastor Larson". The gospel is Mark 8:31-38, corresponding with the [Second Sunday in Lent](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=72)._
