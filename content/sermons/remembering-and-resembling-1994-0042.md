Dear friends in Christ, grace and peace from God our Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ.

I remember Minnie. It was a privilege to come to her door in that modest bungalow. At 103, it took her a while to answer the bell, but when she answered the door, she looked radiant, with her finest dress on, and a bit of makeup. It was a special day for her, the visit of the Pastor to bring communion. It was a special day for me, too. Minnie treasured this time as a chance to find out what was happening at church, and to commune as part of that body of Christ. I treasured the time to visit with one of the saints of God. Minnie always prepared ahead of time...her psalmbook lay open at the table. She knew her catechism, she read the scriptures, and continually sought God's will.

I remember Robert, Minnie's husband. He had been dead about 5 years. When I asked Minnie how it was living alone, she said that Robert told her she would never be alone, that the Lord would be with her. He said "You'll be alright." He was right about that....she remembered those words often.
Jesus said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted." Minnie was blessed.

I remember Ray. He was a leader of the community and a pillar of the church, a gentleman, meek and kind. And he had wonderful lines that wrinkled about his eyes as he smiled. Ray could be counted on to help the congregation in any way. In a pinch, he was liturgist, communion helper, custodian and lector. When the congregation had a difficult decision, Ray could be counted on to provide caring, Christ-like leadership. When he died last year, the church was filled with people who came to praise and thank God for his life. Jesus said, "Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy." Ray was blessed.

This is a day for remembering; remembering saints like Minnie and Ray. It is a day for remembering grandparents and friends who have shown us what it means to belong to Christ. For some of us, the memories are vivid, and for others memory has faded. We remember those who show us the way to blessing. One thing I remember today is that some of the saints I have known have blessed me from the fullness of their lives....they have lived in grateful thanks for all that God has done....the cup of God's grace has run over from them to me. Others I remember today have blessed me out of the emptiness of their lives, for indeed Jesus promises to bless not only the times of fulness and blessing, but also the empty times...."blessed are those who mourn, those who thirst for righteousness, those who are persecuted..." I have been blessed by those who in the empty times of tragic loss or chronic depression or personal injustice have relied upon God--and have been blessed. These are saints of God, too. They are not all icons of perfection, or figures in stained glass, they are people who have known this world's blessings and pains, and in all of life have found God.

Today is not only for looking back, it is also for looking ahead. As we remember people who inspired us, who now have gone to their reward, we also ask of ourselves...."What do I want my life to mean?" How would I like to be remembered?" When we ask what's important in life, the answer is to 'get ahead'." To 'get ahead' is defined in terms of a good job, a good income, and 'success'. Who would wish for less? All Saints Day helps us view success and happiness in life in a new (or rather old) way. Jesus' blessings are not about the world's route to success .... instead they have to do with the way of the cross, the way of faithfulness to God and others, a way that others have gone before us.

We are fortunate that God has given us some audio-visuals to capture what it means to be blessed in this life. We have been given the examples of the faithful who have touched our lives in special ways. Perhaps it is a Sunday School teacher who always knew when we needed to talk. Or a friend who helped us to overcome foolish impulses and think more maturely.
In our congregation's confirmation program, we have added 'Partner in Faith' as a part of this growing experience. Congregations are blessed with those people who in their own way model what it is to be faithful today. In the vision of the throne in the book of Revelation we have the promise that we shall see God's face. All Saints day gives us the promise that we can also behold God's face in our day....for me the face of Minnie, radiant with 103 years of wrinkles and a bit of rouge and lipstick, and Ray's round face with the smiling eyes. They resemble Christ for me, they show me God's face in a way that is not perfect....for none of the saints are perfect. But it is helpful for me to have seen God at work in these people, blessing their full and empty places, using them as vessels of love and grace.

We are called to join these saints in resembling Christ. Have you ever wondered, in the days to come, when your earthly life is spent, who will remember you? Who will say, "I saw the face of Christ" in you? Will it be your children, your friends, the people you worked with? To live in a way that resembles Christ; to be meek, thirsting for righteousness, to be a peacemaker---this is our call. This is God's measure of success. We will never attain perfection here---but in some measure each of us will reflect the love and grace and peace of Christ as we walk through this life.

Today, with ten thousand times then thousand of the saints in light, we gather around the risen and ascended Lord. He blesses us even as he turns the ideas of this world upside down. Christ blesses us in the fullness of life, abundant life running over. Christ blesses us also in the empty times---when there is no one else to turn to for help.

This is Minnie's day--it is Ray's day... it is day for all those we remember in our prayers today...and it is our day, too. The same abundant grace that filled them is poured upon us, too. Our walk through this life continues, and in it our faithfulness is blessed. Today we sing of others, and one day may others remember and sing of us (in the words of our hymn): "O blest communion, fellowship divine!
We feebly struggle, they in glory shine;
Yet all are one in thee, for all are thine.
Alleluia! Alleluia!"

+The peace of God which passes all understanding keep us one with all the saints in Christ Jesus. Amen.
