_Typed sermon from 1973. Originally listed as a "Trinity XV" sermon, but that was crossed out, likely due to the changes in lectionary since the 1970s._

_Later, the season was changed to [Ash Wednesday](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=17134&z=l&d=24), as the gospel text is listed as Matthew 6: 19-23, which works for year A above, but also [Year B](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=382&z=l&d=24) and [Year C](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=384&z=l&d=24)._
