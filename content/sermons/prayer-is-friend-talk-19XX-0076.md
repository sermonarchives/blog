_This is an undated, typed sermon with a handwritten closing, as well as some handwritten corrections. I'm going to guess this as coming from 1973? It was originally listed as being from Trinity XXI, but that was crossed out and 22 Pentecost C was written over it._

_The reason I'm guessing 1973 as the year this sermon what typed is that there is a reference to gas rationing, and that started in [September and October of 1973](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/1970s-gas-shortages-changed-america-180977726/), which is around the time of the church year that a sermon like this may have been be preached._
