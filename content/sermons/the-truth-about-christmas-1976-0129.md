_On the second day of Christmas in 1976, Pastor Larson gave to thee, one handwritten sermon!_

_Apparently the day after Christmas is also known as St. Stephens Day. The Gospel text of Matthew 23:34-49 doesn't appear to correlate to any of the texts in the Revised Common Lectionary. There's a fun section of the sermon about "Christ, the mother hen" in here._
