_Here is a typed sermon from November 25th. The year is unknown, but I suspect that it might be 1981 or 1984. It is an Advent sermon._

_The sermon starts with a reference to [The Adventures of Tom Sawyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer). There is also a reference to [Pastor Bruce Larson](https://www.seattlepi.com/seattlenews/article/bruce-larson-1925-2008-pastor-hailed-as-1295155.php), who served as pastor of University Presbyterian Church during a decade of strong growth and later ministered in the Crystal Cathedral in California.  The gospel text is Mark 13:31-37, which corresponds to the [First Sunday of Advent](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=382&z=a&d=1) in Year B of the Revised Common Lectionary, though the original lectionary was listed as "Last S. after Trinity" and crossed out._
