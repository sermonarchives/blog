_Printed and highlighted sermon from 1989. There does not appear to be a title. It references the President, and the context from 1989 is different from that of 2019._

_Sermon text listed as Luke 3:21-22, for [The Baptism of The Lord](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=107). At the end, it references a hymn, which likely followed it in the service. The hymn is LBW Hymn 194, [All Who Believe and Are Baptized](https://hymnary.org/hymn/LBoW1978/194)._
